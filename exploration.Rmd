# Regions

We want to find all of the regions that are incorporated in this data set so we will group the city variable and calculate how many of each city there is.

```{r}
ds_jobs %>%
  group_by(City) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))
```

Having done this, we see that the larger cities are most often found. We want to incorporate the suburban areas around these big cities to get a better regional report of where the DS jobs are.

```{r}
NY %>%
  group_by(City) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))
```

NY metro area:
* New York
* Brooklyn
* Rego Park (Queens)
* Staten Island
* Bronx
* Fort Lee (in Jersey but would fit the mold of being a part of NYC)
* Jersey City (again, same as Fort Lee, just on opposite side of Hudson River)
* Lynbrook (on Long Island, 1 hour outside of Manhattan)
* Mamaroneck (~1 hour away from Manahattan)
* Maspeth (Queens)
