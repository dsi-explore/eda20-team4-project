# Time series analysis

This data about the job postings are listed from glassdoor scraped during covid time. According to the glassdoor findings, there were very few jobs posted around April end and there's a sudden rise the upcoming week. It's very clear that the job market was not stable during the pandemic.

```{R}
table_date_posted <- data.frame(table(ds_jobs$date_posted))
table_date_posted$Var1 <- as.Date(table_date_posted$Var1, format = "%Y-%m-%d") 
class(table_date_posted$Var1)
ggplot(table_date_posted, aes(x = Var1, y = Freq)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(title = "Job availability vs Date posted",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Number of jobs")
```
