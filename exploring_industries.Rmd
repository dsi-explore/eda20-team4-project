# Exploring  around different industries in the data set ad sorting to find out which industry has the highest number of jobs


```{r}
industry <- table(ds_jobs$Industry)
sorted_industry <- industry[order(-industry)]

```


We see that, Information technolody, business services and biotech are the top 3 industries considering all the regions. From the exploration around regions file, we see that NY tops the list. Find out more about industries only in NY region.

```{r}
NY %>%
  group_by(Industry) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))
```

Even though healthcare is not in the top 3 while considering industries providing more job opportunities, when combining it with regions and analysing for NY, we find that there are more health care jobs!! Now, that seems interesting

Proceeding further, we can see about the salary range.
