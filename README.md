# What are the best options for jobs in the Data Science field?

In this project we explored job openings in the data science field that were listed on Glassdoor. We wanted to analyze data science job postings to see what kind of roles were most needed, where and in what industries these jobs were needed, what salary ranges were offered for different positions and what kinds of skills were companies looking for in candidates. 

Look [here](https://www.kaggle.com/atharvap329/glassdoor-data-science-job-data) for the source of our data and [here](https://github.com/Atharva-Phatak/Glassdoor-Jobs_Data-Analysis) to see the data collection process of scraping the Glassdoor [website](https://www.glassdoor.co.in/index.htm). 

To navigate this project and see our analysis we have outlined the repo as follows:

## [1. Pre-Processing](https://github.com/dsi-explore/eda20-team4-project/tree/main/1_Pre-Processing)
This folder contains our original [data files](https://github.com/dsi-explore/eda20-team4-project/tree/main/1_Pre-Processing/glassdoor_data) as well as the [code](https://github.com/dsi-explore/eda20-team4-project/blob/main/1_Pre-Processing/1_1_Clean_Data.md) used to process and clean our data. In this code we cleaned up variables and missing values as well as added new features to our data set. We used [data](https://github.com/dsi-explore/eda20-team4-project/blob/main/1_Pre-Processing/advisorsmith_cost_of_living_index.csv) for the [Cost of Living Index (COI)](https://advisorsmith.com/data/coli/) to scale salary by cost of living. 

## [2. Data](https://github.com/dsi-explore/eda20-team4-project/tree/main/2_Data)
In this folder we store the tidy [data set](https://github.com/dsi-explore/eda20-team4-project/blob/main/2_Data/ds_jobs.csv) used for all of our analysis. We also have a [data dictionary](https://github.com/dsi-explore/eda20-team4-project/blob/main/2_Data/Data%20Dictionary.md) that lists all the variables in our data set with a brief description about each variable. 

## [3. Results](https://github.com/dsi-explore/eda20-team4-project/tree/main/3_Results)
The bulk of our analysis is in this folder. We started our research looking at different [roles](https://github.com/dsi-explore/eda20-team4-project/blob/main/3_Results/3_1_Data-Science-roles.md) within the field of data science. Next, we looked at the 5 [industries](https://github.com/dsi-explore/eda20-team4-project/blob/main/3_Results/3_2_Industry.md) with the most data science roles in our data set and followed with an analysis of [Glassdoor ratings](https://github.com/dsi-explore/eda20-team4-project/blob/main/3_Results/3_3_Ratings---Company.md) and counts for companies with data science roles. We then looked at [salary ranges](https://github.com/dsi-explore/eda20-team4-project/blob/main/3_Results/3_4_Salary.md) for data science roles within different metro areas, for different positions and in the top 5 industries. We peformed [text analysis](https://github.com/dsi-explore/eda20-team4-project/blob/main/3_Results/3_5_Text-Analysis.md) to see what kind of skills a candidate should be improving upon in looking for data science roles. Lastly, we did a [comparision](https://github.com/dsi-explore/eda20-team4-project/blob/main/3_Results/3_6_San-Fran-vs-DC.md) between the two metro areas in our data set with the most data science roles: San Francisco Bay area and Washington D.C.

## 4. Final Project
This folder contains our [final report]() and [slide deck]() for our presentation.
