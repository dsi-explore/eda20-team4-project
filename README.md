# What are the best options for jobs in the Data Science field?

In this project we explored job openings in the data science field that were listed on Glassdoor. We wanted to analyze data science job postings to see what kind of roles were most needed, where and in what industries these jobs were needed, what salary ranges were offered for different positions and what kinds of skills were companies looking for in candidates. 

Look [here](https://www.kaggle.com/atharvap329/glassdoor-data-science-job-data) for the source of our data and [here](https://github.com/Atharva-Phatak/Glassdoor-Jobs_Data-Analysis) to see the data collection process of scraping the Glassdoor [website](https://www.glassdoor.co.in/index.htm). 

To navigate this project and see our analysis we have outlined the repo as follows:
